% This function performs a simple 2AFC experiment with the image in signalPresentImage, 
% and noiseOnlyImage. SignalPresentImage and noiseOnlyImage are both 
% (dim * dim). The variable 'signalItself' 
% contains a picture of the signal one is trying to detect.

% This routine will bring three images: the center image contains the
% signal, and the user must choose which of the left or right images 
% contains the signal by clicking either on the left or right image.

% The inputs to this function are the dimension of the images in the array,
% an array of images with a signal present, an array of images without a
% signal present, and an image of the isolated signal.

% The output of this function is the number of images that the user
% correctly selected as having the signal present. 

% Note: Ideally, 2AFC experiments are done under very controlled conditions
% such as lighting, distance to monitor, gray-levels, etc.  This routine
% does not control these situations.  In light of this, this routine exists
% mainly to familiarize one with the 2AFC framework, and shouldn't be used
% in actual experiments.


% initializing the value of answerValue as 0, it will remain 0 if incorrect
% or change to 1 if the user answers correctly
answerValue = 0; 


% dividing the images by their maximum pixel value normalizes them to the
% same scale. This allows the images to concatenated into one image array
% without affecting the display of the individual images

% max(max(signalItself)) returns the max pixel value of the coordinates 
% image signalItself to signalMax
signalMax = max(max(signalItself));


% dividing the coordinates image signalItself by the max pixel value signalMax 
signalItself = signalItself/signalMax; 

% creates an array that is nImages by 2 coordinates of zeros
coordinates = zeros(1,2);

% max(max(signalImage))returns the max pixel value of the array signal as
% signalMax
signalPresentMax = max(max(signalPresentImage));
% dividing the array signal by the max pixel value signalPresentMax
signalPresentImage = signalPresentImage/signalPresentMax;
  
% max(max(noise)) returns the max pixel value of the array noise to
% noiseMax
noiseMax = max(max(noiseOnlyImage));
% dividing the array signal by the max pixel value noiseMax
noiseOnlyImage = noiseOnlyImage/noiseMax;
  
% In the psychophysical study sometimes the image with  the signal is 
% going to be to the right and sometimes it will be to the left

% concatenating 3 image arrays to be 1 image array

% signalImage is on the left
A = [signalPresentImage signalItself noiseOnlyImage];

% signalImage is on the right
B = [noiseOnlyImage signalItself signalPresentImage];

% So, flip = rand; picks a random # between 0 and 1
flip = rand;

% if random # is greater than 0.5 then it flips the images so it displays
% image array A
if (flip >= 0.5)
    % signalImage is on left and noiseImage is on right
    
    % minimum pixel value in A 
    minA = min(min(A));
    % maximum pixel value in A
    maxA = max(max(A));
    % imshow displays image based on range of pixel values of the image A 
    imshow(A,'DisplayRange',[minA maxA],'InitialMagnification','fit')
    % pixelFactor is the multiplicative value chosen to magnify the pixels
    % of the images displayed. This is done with the truesize command by
    % multiplying trueSize with the size(A) (which is the # of pixels in
    % the x and y direction)
    truesize(pixelFactor*size(A))
    
    
    
% if random # is less than 0.5 then it doesn't flip the images so it
% displays image array B
else
    % minimum pixel value in A 
    minB = min(min(B));
    % maximum pixel value in A
    maxB = max(max(B));

    imshow(B,'DisplayRange',[minB maxB]','InitialMagnification','fit')
    % pixelFactor is the multiplicative value chosen to magnify the pixels
    % of the images displayed. This is done with the truesize command by
